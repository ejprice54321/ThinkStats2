# Examining the Opioid Crisis

## Emma Price

Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), I want to examine the trends, causes, correlations, other interested data trends specifically relating to opioid abuse and the opioid crisis. I hope to investigate the causes of the opioid epidemic and look into trends in the groups affected.

I am planning to use the NSDUH dataset. I know how to access it, but I am unsure of what the best form of the data is for our use? I am also unsure of how to combine the data that I pull from different years of the survey. I think that I will start analyzing across just the most recent survey results, then start to incorporate time analysis. From what I can tell there are not restrictions on my use of the data, though I would expect that there is no personal health information included in the data.

There are definitely ethical concerns with using such sensitive data about a very sensitive and widespread topic. My biggest personal ethical concern is forgetting that the information conveyed in this data is so serious and life-threatening and just thinking of it as just data. I don't know that there is anything that I should flat-out not do with the data because of my ethical concerns, but I should be careful about what conclusions I draw from the data and it is very important how I present information that I find.

My project definitely falls more on the exploratory side of the spectrum, but some of the topics within the opioid epidemic include:
- Past drug use
- Effects of home life
- Mental health
- Demographic effects

There is a ton of data in this data set, so there will probably be more topics that I add to this list as I go.
